                            <p>PINGU is put out when he loses several games of hide and seek and to make matters his friends are laughing at his efforts to find them. When he sees a ladder PINGU has the perfect solution and climbs up an iceberg from where he is able to see all the hiding places. But the tables are turned when the others remove the ladder and PINGU is left stranded on his vantage point.</p>

                            <p>PINGU refuses to help Mother and instead locks himself in his room. Finally, when everything is quiet PINGU leaves room and sees Mother, Father and Pinga hanging out the washing and feels a little left out. As he is realising his selfishness the line breaks under the weight of the washing and only PINGU stepping in prevents the clothes ending up on the ground and he gets the attention of his family once more.</p>

Father encourages and helps him and together they reach the top of the mountain from where they can enjoy the beautiful views from above the village.</p>

They only catch small fish and it’s so much fun at the waterside that even when it gets dark they aren’t bothered. When his father has to come and find him PINGU is told to come home at once. The fish that PINGU had caught are appreciated by all but he realised that he went too far.</p>

Instead of playing with Pinga, PINGU takes his bike and starts showing off to Pingi. Pinga meanwhile after feeling a bit left out goes inside to be with mother.</p>

He comes up with the idea of an ice garage which Robby helps him make. When Father gets home he is very impressed by the idea of a garage and also by PINGU and Robby for building it.</p>

He sledges about and meets all his friends but they all have work to do. PINGU however is still going to enjoy freedom and it is not until he realises that even the mother bird is working looking for food for her young that he remembers his own mother. He rushes home and tells Mother to take a rest.</p>

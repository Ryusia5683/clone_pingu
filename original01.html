But, when he turns round his fish are gone! Robby the seal ensures that PINGU catches the same fish every time and eats the bait while he is at it. PINGU can not work it out but once he lures Robby out of the water he meets the trickster and is able to see the funny side of the situation. A firm friendship is formed.</p>

                            <p>The two penguin children try everything in order not to have to go to bed. First they need to go to the loo again, then they’re thirsty, then they have to have the light on, and then the door has to be left just a little bit ajar. Their mother is worn out, and falls asleep on the chair and when they see this the children realise what they have done help their mother to bed.</p>

                            <p>PINGU is admiring a penguin friend's fantastic new skis. He is even allowed to stand on the back of them and ski along with him. However as they go he spots a broken barrel and has an idea. He soon has a pair of home-made skis and they set off again. But when they start showing off it all ends up in a heap of broken skis both old and new.</p>

PINGU is sent outside while his parents clear up the chaos. As he wanders in the growing dark PINGU begins to see faces in the all the snowdrifts and is very relieved when his father comes out to find him and takes him home.</p>

PINGU takes the poor man to his run-down igloo. Then he takes the barrel-organ and plays outside the baker’s, the fishmongers’, the tailor’s and in front of the drinks store. In turn each shopkeeper donates some goods. On his return PINGU is laden with food for the organ grinder and, while he eats, even patches up his igloo.</p>

Suddenly a huge walrus terrifies him and when he dreams he has fallen down a slope in an attempt to get away he is very relieved to find himself at home tangled up in his sheets.</p>

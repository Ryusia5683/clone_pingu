A photojournalist who comes rushing along takes a picture of the two friends with the balloon. When they go to get the film developed however it transpires that PINGU had forgotten to take off the lens cap and none of the photos come out. Luckily the picture in the newspaper shows PINGU and his friends in front of the balloon so they always have that to treasure.</p>

The glue gets everywhere, and if the card isn’t stuck to Pingu’s flipper or Mother’s newspaper, then its glued shut! Pingu gives up, until Pinga gives him an idea for a unique and glue-free card! Pingu goes over to Pingi’s, and she is delighted with her Valentine.</p>

Pingu has to follow Pinga and keep her out of trouble as she rambles through people’s homes and washing lines, around sharp icicles and over a ravine on her night time moonwalk…</p>

                            <p>Pingu is bouncing on everything in the igloo, from his bed to the armchairs and even Pinga’s favourite toy. Mother tells him to calm down, and goes out with Pinga, leaving Father to help Pingu tidy up. Father knows that it can be fun to bounce, so he and Pingu decide to build a trampoline. But Pingu soon realises that he is going to need a crash helmet!</p>

When Pingu puts Pinga’s favourite toy rabbit up out of her reach on the windowsill, it tumbles out of the window. Forced to go and fetch the rabbit, Pingu kicks it back towards the igloo – but it lands on his sled and slides away. Pingu goes on a frantic hunt for the lost Rabbit and finally returns it to find that Pinga has transferred her affections to another toy!</p>

But the wind is more than they had bargained for and when the towels get caught by a big gust, Pingu and Pinga give chase. When they return, they are too exhausted to play with Father and his kite!</p>

None are successful until a balloon seller supplies Pingu with some helium balloons. Suddenly it’s up, up and away! But Pingu realises that being 'grounded' is actually the best way for a penguin to be…</p>

Soon he and Robby are tunnelling around the neighbourhood and things start sinking into the snow in their wake! Pingu and Robby find themselves in trouble when the Fishmonger loses a crate of his fish and Mother and Father’s picnic disappears below ground!</p>

With Father and Grandfather’s help, Pingu gets the legs back on - but the table is looking a bit wobbly…</p>

                            <p>When Pingu’s Grandfather tells him all about the moon, Pingu desperately wants to visit. With Pinga’s help, Pingu makes a rocket out of an old barrel, some tin foil and snow. But when they pretend that the rocket has landed on the moon, they are shocked to see an alien face at the window - until they realize that it’s only Grandfather joining in!</p>

                            <p>Pingu and Pinga put up a tent and Mother allows them to sleep in it overnight. Pingu insists that brave explorers don’t need to bring their cuddly toys camping with them. But Pinga insists on bringing her bunny. So Pingu scares Pinga by making her think that the bunny is growling. She is so frightened that she throws bunny out of the tent. Pingu gets his comeuppance though when he mistakes the silhouette of Robby eating their food for a giant, ferocious rabbit!</p>

                            <p>Pingu is trying to read his book in peace, but Pinga develops the hiccups, and he just can’t concentrate! He takes her to the Post Office to see if Father can cure her, but none of the tricks Father knows – hand-stands, being shaken upside-down, blowing into a paper bag – have the right effect. So Pingu decides to scare her by putting on a pair of icicle fangs - but the only person he scares is himself! Luckily this makes Pinga laugh until her hiccups are cured.</p>

But Pingu is frustrated when Father won’t let him cut a hole in the ice – even though Pingu feels that he could do a better job! When Pingu gets some big bites, Father takes over and firstly lets the fish escape, then later takes all the credit for landing a fish that Pingu had hooked. But in the end, Father accepts that Pingu sometimes knows best, and lets his son navigate on the journey home, and gives Pingu all the credit for the biggest fish!</p>

                            <p>Everyone except Pingu seems to be entering the local Ice Sculpture Contest. Pingu wants to play instead, and tries to distract Robby from his masterpiece by throwing snowballs. When a snowball hits the sculpture and makes it look bug-eyed, Pingu and Robby start to compete, making more and more freaky shapes. Soon they’re working together on the weirdest sculpture of all, and eventually beat Father and Pinga to take first prize in the contest!</p>

                            <p>Pinga wants to play with her new balloon - but it needs inflating first. Pingu and Father find that blowing up this particular balloon will be harder than they’d ever thought possible! Simply blowing won’t do it, nor will a bicycle pump, and Pinga’s getting impatient! Pingu gets an idea when he sees mother using bellows to stoke the stove. He puts the balloon over the bellows’ nozzle, and he and Father bounce Pinga up and down on the bellows as the balloon inflates perfectly!</p>

When she sends them out, they try to interest Father in their penguin percussion - but the Post Office is no place for such a racket, so he sends them to Grandfather. When Grandfather inspires Pingu to make real music with icicles and a fish skeleton, Mother and Father realise what talented kids they have!</p>

But when Mother tells Father to go in and settle them down, he finds it hard to resist joining in...</p>

Things soon get out of hand when their labelling spree goes beyond the igloo, and soon they are both claiming Mother! But when they come to a playground where Pinga claims the swing and Pingu claims the seesaw, they realise that they have more fun when they share and playing together.</p>

Pingu can’t wait for his family to hear the new doorbell’s funky tones, but when he rings it, they are confused by the crazy jingle they hear. When Grandfather visits and also rings the bell, Father can no longer stand the noise and decides to find out what Pingu did with the trusty old bell…</p>

Mother soon gives him a big coloured ball to stop him practicing with anything he can get his flippers on. Robby is still showing off his skills outside, and laughs at Pingu’s efforts to balance the ball. But when Robby flicks his fish on top of the shed and Pingu climbs on top of his big ball to reach it, he finds that he can balance on the ball. Everyone is extremely impressed.</p>
